- **Length bias**: Longer genes are more likely to generate more reads than shorter ones with similar expression levels.

- **Differences in library size composition**: Since the sequencing depth (number of reads per samples) is pre-determined as part of the sequencing strategy, skewed read count distribution within samples can mask finer details in gene expression profile.
  
- Between-sample differences in library size must be necessarily corrected before comparing samples to detect differentially expressed genes.

## Read Count Normalization: What should I use?

- **Use RPKM/FPKM** when comparing gene expression within a **single sample** (e.g., understanding relative expression of genes within the same condition).
- **Use TPM** when comparing gene expression **between samples** because TPM ensures that total expression values are comparable across samples.
- **Use CPM** for **differential expression analysis**, especially with raw counts, as it retains variance information required by statistical methods (e.g., edgeR, DESeq2).
