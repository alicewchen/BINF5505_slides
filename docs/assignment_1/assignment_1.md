## Types of Genome

**Structural Genomics**

Aims to *determine the structure* of every protein encoded by the genome. Also helps us to understand the functions of proteins.

**Functional Genomics**

Aims to collect and use data from sequencing for *describing genes & proteins functions*, such as protein-protein interactions.

**Comparative Genomics**

Aims to compare genomic features b/w different species.

**Mutational Genomics**

Studies the genome in terms of mutations that occur in a personâ€™s DNA or Genome. It is the field of genomics that characterizes mutation-associated genes. In this, we basically focus on genomics, epigenetics, and transcript alterations in cancer. In mutational genomics, the difficult task is finding genes that underlie transcriptional changes.

### What is a genome browser?

Genome browsers *integrate genomic sequence and annotation data* from different sources and provide a platform to search, browse, retrieve, and analyze genomic data.

They *differ from ordinary biological databases* in that they display data in a graphical format, with genome coordinates on one axis with annotations or space-filling graphics to show analyses of the genes, such as the frequency of the genes, their expression profiles, etc.

**What is meant by annotation of data?**

Annotation means attaching biological information to sequences.

### Importance of Genome Browser

- Genome Browser *supports text and sequence-based searches* that provide quick, precise access to any region of specific interest.
- Genome browsers enable researchers to *visualize and browse entire genomes* with annotated data including gene prediction and structure, proteins, expression, regulation, variation, comparative analysis, etc. Annotated data is usually from multiple diverse sources.
- Genome browsers are extremely useful for *viewing and interpreting the many different types of data* that can be anchored to genomic positions. These include variation, transcription.
- Many large genomic projects also incorporate genome browsers into their web portals to enable users to easily search and view the data. These include:
    1. GTEx
    2. gnomAD

- Data is an overlay from **seven different cell lines**.
- **H3K Tracks: Height represents intensity** of acetylation of lysine on the H3 histone.
    - Higher peaks = more acetylation
    - High histone acetylation often indicates regulatory elements.
- **DNase I Hypersensitivity Track:** peaks indicate potential regulatory or promoter regions

- Highly conserved sequences often have important biological functions
    - Exons are highly conserved across species.
    - Regions outside show faster evolution.
